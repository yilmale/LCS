    "The narrative specification is defined in terms of a *narrative frame* that characterizes the beliefs, goals, and actions of individuals. Each one of these cognitive elements has its initial activation level. These activation levels can vary at the time of instantiation so that simulated individuals that embrace the perspective specified by the frame can have similar but distinct traits. Such variation induces diversity in the population. The narrative frame is subject to positive and negative constraints, which influence the activation dynamics of the cognitive system. When the evidence nodes are updated as a result of the actions of the simulated narratives, the percepts observed by  inviduals trigger updates in the belief and goal nodes of their narratives through the excitatory and inhibitory constraints to effect change.
